Saito, M., Iwabuchi, H., & Murata, I. (2016). Estimation of spectral distribution of sky radiance using a commercial digital camera. Applied Optics, 55(2), 415.
----------------------------------------------

Data:
430-680nm
194 total samples/images (not clear how many were used for spectral bias graphs)
Results shown for 3 images and thus 3 zenith samples

Contributions:
(*) Estimating spectral distribution without training sets
(*) More accurate solution for deriving color matching functions (CMFs) of cameras:
 - Improved upon experiment by (Sigernes et al. - Sensitivity calibration of digital colour cameras for auroral imaging)
 - Saito et al. claim that Signernes' experiment "provided erroneous CMFs".
 - Lens "wavelength dependence" and vignetting effect was considered, showing that pixel counts decline the farther they are from the center pixel
 - "optimal estimation method" for computing RGB counts using "maximum a posteriori" (MAP) with Sigernes' camera as prior information
 - CMOS noise was considered (calculated from stddev of RGB counts in 8x8 blocks)
(*) Estimating spectral shape per pixel using a single linear algebra equation, using total ozone column and RGB RAW counts

Weaknesses:
(*) Focuses on wavelengths 430-680nm. Diverging results above 680nm are speculated to be calibration and calculation bias.
(*) Only "the zenith" is considered in the experiments, so likely sample point in middle of the sky
(*) CMF matrices are created from samples of spectral radiance (every 5nm and every 10nm) and then integrated. Exact values are not used.
(*) Calibration of USB4000 spectrometer may be suspect below 450nm due to low signal-to-noise ratio.
(*) Temperature dependence of CMOS response and stray light are said to be "two major error sources that may lead to significant uncertainty". These are reported to contribute ~5% uncertainty each.
(*) Lens distortion is dismissed as negligible as "several studies have shown that recent commercially available lenses exhibited very slight distortions".

Error metrics:
RMSD of spectral radiance (16-18% between 430-680nm)
SSB (spectral shape bias) = normalizing the spectral radiance at 550nm with itself = Icam(lamda)/Iother(lamda) * Iother(550nm)/Icam(550nm) - 1

----------------------------------------------

Data:
380-760nm
333 total images (!! merged from 11655 images, 35 images per capture timestamp)
37629 total samples (!! absolute maximum; very likely less; not specified in paper)

Contributions:
(*) Full hemisphere (113 spectroradiometer scan points)
(*) Full visible spectrum (an improvement over previous methods)
(*) Non-linear regressions learned for each wavelength (1143 of them, 3 per wavelength studied), using the non-linear relationship between RGB counts to radiance value
(*) Nice visualization of full hemisphere error (at 500nm only)

Weaknesses:
(*) 2 distinct models (cloud-free and overcast). No uniform model across all skies.
(*) Full hemisphere scans took 12min. "In order to use the radiance distribution of the CCD spectroradiometer for the validation, a synchronized HSI image is constructed. [...] the pixels of each scan point were taken from the corresponding all-sky image, depending on the time of measurement"
(*) Only 1 cloud-free and 1 overcast day used for training - small percentage of data used for training compared to validation
(*) Spectroradiometer measure every 2nm, not every wavelength
(*) Different regressions would need to be computed for different cameras (exposure, aperature, etc.)
(*) No validation against simulated models

Error metrics:
MBD
RMSD

Validation:

----------------------------------------------

Data:
1018 cloudless sky images captured between 10/2005 to 02/2006

Contributions:
(*) Calculating/estimating/deriving aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom turbidity α parameter, which affects aeorsol features and size and ultimately radiance curve
(*) Use of neural network due to "limited success of analytical procedures"

Weaknesses:
(*) Only 2 wavelengths considered (440 and 670), because ultimately doing red/blue cloud detection.
(*) 2 separate neural network models, one for each wavelength.
(*) training set diversity is limited (by their own remarks) - few case of high AOD and small α parameter
(*) Data divided into Train/Test, no cross-validation mentioned. Division not specified.

Error metrics:

----------------------------------------------

Data:
440-1020nm Angstrom α parameter
50 total images
1000 total samples

Contributions:
(*) Objective vs subjective estimation of cloud cover
(*) Use of neural network for cloud cover estimation problem in real time
 - 18 features (originally)
 - RGB and grayscale of pixels and mean weighted 3x3 region
 - variance for RGB and grayscale of pixels and mean weighted 3x3 region
 - R/G, R/B, G/R, G/B, B/R, B/G ratios
(*) Use of genetic algorithm to try and find the best (most meaningful) inputs to the MLPNN (interesting way to approach feature selection)
 - of the original 18 features, only 3 were used for best results: mean of red pixel and 3x3 region, mean of blue pixel and 3x3 region, variance of red pixel and 3x3 region

Weaknesses:
(*) Lower resolution images (1280x1024)
(*) 1000 total samples divided into 2 for training and testing (cross-validation not mentioned)
(*) The genetic algorithm approach only improved the error metric by 3% (from 82% to 85%)
(*) In regards to existing cloud cover assessment algorithms from all-sky imagers, the authors state "The most used algorithm is based on threshold of the red/blue ratio image [22], but this method has some weakness for cloud classification near the horizon, and in near-Sun regions is unable to distinguish cloud classes." However, they themselves only use images with zenith angles of <= 80°, and their sky imager uses a sun tracker / solar shadowing ball that blocks the sun's position from the lens specifically to avoid sun overexposure

Error metrics:
error in classification rate = number of errors divided by number of test cases
performance = 1 - error rate
okta count (cloud cover assessment)

Validation:
