Clear sky radiance (350-1780 nm) reconstructed from all-sky image and capture time

Whole sky predictions within 7.5% RMSD of measurements, validated with libRadtran

Dataset of 400+ correlated all-sky images and spectroradiometer measurements

Four regression models trained and tested with machine learning techniques

Experiments on raw vs compressed, HDR imagery, color model, and spectrum resolution

Real-time applications of this research are targeted and suggested
